User interface that allows users to login and sign up. This side of the application was done using React.js, CSS for styling, GraphQL and Apollo libraries, and sweetalert for error display.

## :memo: Where do I start?

### Step 1: Set-up
- [ ] `Git clone` https://github.com/hugohp19/stagewood-FronEnd.git
- [ ] `cd` into repository
- [ ] `npm install`
- [ ] `npm start`

### Step 2: Main Dependencies
- [ ] `react-app` run command `$ npm install create-react-app <app-name>`
- [ ] `react-router-dom` run command `$ npm install --save react-router-dom`
- [ ] `apollo/client` run command `$ npm install apollo/client`
- [ ] `graphql` run command `$ npm install graphql`
- [ ] `graphql-tag` run command `$ npm install graphql-tag`
- [ ] `react-apollo` run command `$ npm install react-apollo`

### :memo: Deploying to Heroku?

1. `heroku create <app_name>`
2. `git remote -v` -> make sure to have Heroku as one of the remotes
3. `git push heroku main`

Other helpfull commands after deployment:
1. `git push heroku main` to redeploy after new changes
2. `heroku logs --tail` to see logs (good for troubleshooting)
